 ## Portfolio: About Me 


 -- Technology plays such a big role in this world, in our society. It can influence so many people, keep us connected, but it has allowed us as humans to really expand our experience in this world in so many ways. Hence why technology has always been a passion of mine. It has so many different routes to choose from and challenges your brain in ways other industries do not.
 -- I grew up in a business-oriented family where my siblings and I were pushed to face challenges and new risks every day work ethics and striving for more each day was our everyday motivation. Which has allowed me to build the person that I am today, a self-driven and determined individual who  set out to reach her goals and is eagered to learn more everyday.
